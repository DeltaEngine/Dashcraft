## Minecraft Plugin for storing Build Structures as Non-Fungible-Tokens on the Dash Blockchain

This project develops a Minecraft Creative Server-Plugin for saving NFT's on Dash Platform. A demonstration for the creation of Non-Fungible-Tokens (or Non-Fungible-Assets) and storage on Dash Platform. The client will not need any special software and can just connect to the Creative Server with the default Minecraft game installation.
Minecraft allows building structures within its game and has a well documented Java framework for developing plugins. This prototype will allow selecting and exporting the in-game build structures to Dash Platform and viewing them online on a MineCraft-Explorer website.
The Minecraft Creative server hosted with the Dash-Platform-Plugin for public demonstration will allow building minecraft-structures in creative mode and will showcase one powerful possibility for Dash Platform Data-Contracts and integrations.
